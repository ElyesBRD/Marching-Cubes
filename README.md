# Marching Cubes
This is a marching cubes algorithm that is used for precedural mesh generation in Unity C#.
I tackled this problem with the help of this paper https://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/
Currently the goal of this project is optimizing this algorithm to max effeciency to handle large grid size,
and use that for procedural planet generation.
Currently the algorithm work using the cpu but i intend to create the mesh using the gpu, comming soon..
