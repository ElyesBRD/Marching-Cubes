# Marching Cubes
This is a marching cubes algorithm that is used for precedural mesh generation in Unity C#.

example use for a 3d perline noise:

example use  for a planed generation:

# What is it
I tackled this problem with the help of this paper "https://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/", it is really helpfull at explaining all the necessary details.

# Goal
Currently the goal of this project is optimizing the algorithm to max effeciency to handle large grid size generation,
and to apply this algorithm for procedural terrain and planet generation.
